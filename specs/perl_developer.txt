All Around the World coding test for Perl

The Synopsis
============

You need to read a CSV file named orders.csv, store the contents in an SQLite
database and generate a report from the data. Aside from the requirement to
use Perl and store the data in an SQLite database, you will have complete
freedom to use the tools you're comfortable with.

Most developers need one to four hours to complete the basic task, but will
likely need a bit of extra time making it "production ready".

The Details
===========

You have a client whose Point of Sale (POS) system has very poor reporting
capabilities. She has sent you a CSV file of some orders. The CSV file
contains:

* customers (first name, last name, a customer "number")
* orders (date and number)
* items (name, price, manufacturer)

She would like you to write software to parse the CSV file, store everything
in an SQLite database and later generate a report of items purchased per
order per customer per date. You can use any format you like for the report.
The easier it is to read and understand, the better.

Unfortunately, she will be gone for a week and she's instructed you to use
your best judgement if you have any questions about the data or the task.

Note: the customer has told you that when she returns, she will be using your
code to enter more CSV files every day.

Deliverables
============

The basic task will take most developers between one to four hours to complete
(four hours, at outside). However, you should strive to produce code which is
*production ready* (for whatever definition of "production ready" you feel
comfortable with. This does *not* mean perfect -- we readily accept that no
code is perfect. We have deadlines, unclear specifications (like this one),
and other time constraints. Instead, we expect that you submit to us code
that, while not perfect, is nonetheless an example of the minimum quality you
feel appropriate for production code.

What to send us
---------------

On or before one week of receiving this, you should return
a tarball or zip file containing:

* The code
* The CSV file
* An SQLite database with the data already entered
* A README text document explaining how to build and run the project
* A sample of the final report
* A NOTES text document explaining any decisions you made which you feel are relevant

The NOTES file
--------------

We will be using the NOTES file to understand how you make business and
technical decisions and how you *communicate* those decisions. For example,
there is a reference to "manufacturer" in the CSV file, but it is not required
for the output report. Do you keep the manufacturer data or not? You should
explain what decision you took and why you took it.

Between the README and the NOTES and the code, we should be able to build, run
and assess your project without further clarification from you. The final code
will be run on either Mac OS X Mountain Lion or Debian Stable.

What tools do you use?
----------------------

Anything! We want the code to be in Perl, but other than that, you're
completely free to use anything you wish. The report can be in any format you
wish: text, PDF, HTML, markdown, cuneiform tablets, whatever! Just keep in
mind that if you use something that is hard to install or compile, that might
make it harder for us to evaluate.

In short, we want you to use any tools you feel comfortable with rather than
give you an arbitrary set of tools you must use. We're checking to see if you
can code, not whether or not you can use a set of tools we have already chosen
for you.
