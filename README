Installation instructions for the csv importer/reporter

Security notes:
The SQLite database is created on the same directory of the main scripts, so
the application needs write permission on this directory. If, after
installing you removed write permission on the main directory you will need
to add it back.

This application was tested with perl 5.12.3. Please check with the command 
and output bellow if your version is this or newer.

    $ perl -v
	This is perl 5, version 12, subversion 3 (v5.12.3) built for
	darwin-thread-multi-2level
	(with 2 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

Install the CPAN modules bellow. If any question arises answer using the 
default.
CPAN Modules:
- DBIx::SQLite::Deploy
- DBIx::Class::Schema
- Text::CSV_XS (optional)
- Text::CSV

To install these modules you may use the cpan command bellow when running as 
superuser or prefixing the command with 'sudo' (in this case you will need 
cpan sudo privileges):

    cpan install Text::CSV DBIx::Class::Schema DBIx::SQLite::Deploy

Note: Running CPAN may require additional software installation such as
      developer tools.

Usage
-----

The application have two modules:
- importer.pl -- imports .csv files into the database
- reporter.pl -- generates consolidated order reports from the imported data

importer.pl
-----------

The syntax for importer.pl is:

	cd <directory where application is installed>
    ./importer.pl <csv file 1> <csv file 2> ... <csv file n>

Example, assuming application installed in ~/smith/aatw:

	cd ~/smith/aatw
	./importer ./orders.csv

reporter.pl
-----------

The syntax for reporter.pl is:

	cd <directory where application is installed>
    ./reporter.pl

The report is sent to the standard output (usually the screen). You may 
redirect it to another device (as a printer), to a file or pipe it to a viewer 
such as 'less'.

Example, assuming application installed in ~/smith/aatw:

	cd ~/smith/aatw
	./reporter > sample.rpt

or

	cd ~/smith/aatw
	./reporter | less

Troubleshooting
===============

Error message:

   File "/home/smith/aatw/orders.csv" already imported. Ignoring.

This means a file this full name was already processed. To force it to be 
processed you may rename or move it to another directory.

---

Error message:

   /home/smith/bad.txt: malformed header, expected column headers not present.

This means the file does not have a header line as the sample .csv file, 
indicating a possible corrupt or invalid file. Note that after checking its 
header the file will be processed and corrupt lines may add bad data to the 
database.
